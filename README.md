This repository contains two small projects performed using freely avaiable process datasets. Each project is associated with an iPython notebook.

The first project can be found under the file "iron_ore_flotation_process_modes.ipynb". The associated data is stored in the file "iof_data.zip". 
This project illustrates how data visualisation tools and machine learning methods can be used to derive insights into data for an iron ore flotation process.

The second project is associated with the file "Dow_dataset_forecasting.ipynb". It illustrates how state-of-the-art ensemble methods can be used to develop robust multivariate forecasting models. The relevant dataset for this project is "Dow dataset (anonymised).xlsx".
